This is a project to use a camera and moving light fixture to create a follow light. After setting it up you will have a camera-feed of the stage where you can follow a person with your mouse and PAN/TILT instructions will be sent over sACN to any dmx-controller supporting it.

It started as a python-script written in 6h for Kårspexet 23/24 by Elias Lundell, but has since been rewritten and expanded, and is now being rewritten in Go with [hyperapp](https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp). For the original project see [./python-project/](https://github.com/LogFlames/folje/tree/main/python-project).
